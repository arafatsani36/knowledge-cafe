      <h2>2. What is the useState Hook.</h2>
      <p>Answer :
      <br /> 
      useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.

      <h2>4. How does react work.</h2>
      <p>Answer :
       <br /> 
      React basically maintains a tree for you. This tree is able to do efficient diff computations on the nodes. Think of your HTML code as a tree. React allows you to effectively re-construct your DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred.
